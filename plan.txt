PLAN FOR THE DISCORD BOT 

1:
Write the basics:
    - imports
    - json file to store the hypixel api key and discord token
    - ping command to test that the bot can respond and give an idea of latency
    - ss evidence it in Screenshots

2:
Create a very basic user lookup command:
    - Utilise the mojang api to get a players UUID from a name
    - use the hypixel api to return the players rank and network level

3:
Create a more advanced user lookup:
    - Player rank
    - Online status (y/n)
    - Player rank colour
    - Player level
    - Player Karma

4:
- Create a help command listing the different commands the user can do

5:
- Use discord embeds to make the user lookup look nicer

6:
- Modify the bots status to show users the help command

7:
- Use discord embeds to make the help command look nicer

8:
- Use @client.mention to bring up the help command when the bot is mentioned

9:
- Create a command to display the statistics of a user in a given gamemode
